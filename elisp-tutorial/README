On 18/5/02, I gave a talk at ilugc on elisp.  I am convinced that I
can develop on the material I developed during that talk and make a
proper intro type tutorial out of it.

This directory contains the material for that.  LaTeX appears the
obvious choice for this ;)

Oct. 4, 2004 - 2 years on, said choice is anything but obvious.
