Scoping Rules</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Elisp manual says <I>Local bindings in Emacs Lisp have ``indefinite
  scope'' and ``dynamic extent''.  "Scope" refers to <U>where</U>
  textually in the source code the binding can be accessed.  "Indefinite scope"
  means that any part of the program can potentially access the variable
  binding.  "Extent" refers to <U>when</U>, as the program is executing,
  the binding exists.  "Dynamic extent" means that the binding lasts as long as
  the activation of the construct that established it.</I>

<P>
You can use that to impress your friends; if you can say it with a straight
face.  But, what does it really mean?  The heart of the matter is that if you
look at a lisp function definition, say, and find some variables used, for
which no binding is apparent in the function itself, there is no cause for
worry.  It is alright as long as <I>at the time of execution of that
  function</I> the variable has a binding.  This is very different from a
language like C, where a variable should have a binding in the same textual
block as the usage.

<P>
<PRE>
(defun foo ()
   (message "bar is \%s" bar))
(let ((bar "foo"))
  (foo))
</PRE>
<P>
In the above example, function <TT>foo</TT> is using <TT>bar</TT> which appears
to be a <I>free variable</I>.  When <TT>foo</TT> is invoked as shown inside a
let statement, <TT>foo</TT> gets bound to a value, although the place of usage
is inside another function.  If, however, <TT>foo</TT> is invoked without
providing a local binding as shown, then there will be a runtime error pointing
out that <TT>foo</TT> has no binding.

<P>
Common Lisp is a complicated beast.  Its variables can have either lexical
scope (i.e. C like scoping behaviour), or dynamic scoping (explained above).
Elisp has only dynamic scoping.

<P>
If you really want to know more about scoping and really want to get more
confused, you should feel free to refer to the Elisp manual.
