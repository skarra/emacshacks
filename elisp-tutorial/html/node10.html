Special Forms</A>
</H1>

<P>
In lisp terminology, a ``form'' is the same as an ``expression''.  We saw above
that for <TT>defun</TT> to behave ``correctly'', its arguments should not be
evaluated.  In effect, we are asking for a semantics that is slightly different
from the typical run-of-the-mill function call.  An expression which has this
special semantics is called a ``special form''.  Thus, a special form is, by
definition, a function specially marked such that not all of its arguments are
evaluated.  Most special forms define control structures or perform variable
bindings - things that functions cannot do.  <TT>defun</TT> is the only
special form that we have encountered thus far.  The total number of available
special forms is quite small, but we shall not look into all of them, rather,
in order to give you some more feel about the need for special forms, we shall
look a couple more.

<P>
In most modern languages the boolean operators <TT>or</TT> and <TT>and</TT>
(``||'' and ``&amp;&amp;'' in C, C++ and Java) have a property known as
``short-circuiting''.  This short circuiting property enables us to safely
write code that looks like this:

<P>
<PRE>
if (p &amp;&amp; p-&gt;data == 0) {
  // ...
}
</PRE>
<P>
In the above code snippet, the second expression <TT>p-&gt;data == 0)</TT> is
evaluated only if necessary.  The <TT>and</TT> function in lisp also has this
short-circuiting property, and the lisp version looks something like this:

<P>
<PRE>
(and (not (null p))
     (= data 0))
</PRE>
<P>
In order to effect this short-circuiting property, we cannot allow the normal
evaluation semantics of a typical function call as that will evaluate both the
sub expressions.  For this reason <TT>or</TT> is implemented as a special form
in Elisp.  The advanced reader might be interested to know that in Common Lisp,
many of the constructs that are special forms in Elisp special forms are
actually implemented as macros.

<P>
Early on, when talking about types of expressions, we mentioned that the
variable assignment expression <TT>(setq foo 10)</TT> is special, but did not
elaborate.  With your new found enlightenment, you should have no trouble
seeing that <TT>setq</TT> is a special form.  For, if it were a regular
function, the first argument <TT>foo</TT> would be evaluated, and we would not
quite be able to <B>assign</B> a new value to it.

<P>
The Emacs Lisp Manual lists the complete list of available special forms in
Elisp.
