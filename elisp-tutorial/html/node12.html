Variables</A>
</H1>

<P>
Before we go further into how variables are treated in Elisp, we should really
revisit the real meaning a ``variable''.  OK, stop staring.  This fundamental
concept in programming is also somewhat notorious in that most folks (including
professional programmers) do not have a sound handle on it.  It is my firm
belief that a lack of a solid understanding of this concept is the real reason
why so many people have trouble understanding pointers in C and C++.

<P>
That is not to say that the concept of a <I>Variable</I> is trivial to
understand.  As a matter of fact, philosophers of the 19th and early 20th
centuries, working on systematising the logical foundation of mathematics,
found it fairly difficult to nail down the nature of <I>variable</I>s they so
happily used in their symbolic logic proofs and what not.  They agonised over a
suitable definition for it.  Bertrand Russell, in <I>The Principles of
  Mathematics</I>, published in 1903, says:

<P>
<P>

<P></P>
<I>The variable is perhaps the most distinctively
      mathematical of all notions; it is certainly also one of the most
      difficult to understand.</I> [...much philisophical mumbo-jumbo snipped..]
    <I>It appears from the above discussion that the variable is a very
      complicated logical entity, by no means easy to analyse
      correctly.</I>
<P></P>


<P>
It is generally conceeded by philosophers that the concept did not receive
complete clarity till computer scientists arrived on the scene, and pointed out
that a variable is a named location.  That's it.  Imagine a location in the RAM
of your computer that is identified by a unique address and also given a name.
This is just like a real-life domestic post box.  Each post box has a unique
address, and each such address also has a name, not necessarily unique (Note
however that the name+address combo is unique).  A variable also has some
contents, just like a real-life post box has some letters inside it.  So, when
we say ``x is a variable'', it is short for ``there is a location in memory
that we call x; this memory location can contain different things contents at
different points in time''.  (Note that the contents of a variable do not
define the variable, hence in the above definition, we restrict it to the name
and location)

<P>
There is a special twist in the way Lisp handles variables, and this issue
needs to be clarified before going into details of the actual handling of
variables.
