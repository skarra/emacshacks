Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>
Lisp was invented (or some would say 'discovered') by John McCarthy in the
1960s as a high level general purpose language.  He also happened to coin the
term ``Artificial Intelligence''.  He, his students and his co-workers began
using Lisp for their programming tasks and before no time, Lisp got its name
intimately entangled with Artificial Intelligence.  Lisp, however, is not all
about AI; it is a general purpose high level language like C, Perl, Java, and
Python.  To give you an idea, Lisp is used as the extension language for
Autocad, an industry standard CAD program, for Interleaf, a high end publishing
program, and of course in Emacs.  Lisp was also used by Paul Graham and Robert
Morris to build a product that eventually became the foundation of Yahoo Store.

<P>
Lisp has evolved over the years and many dialects are in use.  Common Lisp,
Scheme, Emacs Lisp are, but a few.  Some might even say Lisp is really a family
of closely related languages.  Be that as it may, these days when someone
refers to just plain ``Lisp'', she is very likely talking about ``Common
Lisp'', if at all she knows what she is talking about; i.e.  Common Lisp is the
standardised version of Lisp, with formally defined syntax and semantics.  What
ISO C is to C, Common Lisp is to Lisp.

<P>
Scheme is a dialect that eschews the more complex features of Lisp and is
widely used in introductory undergraduate courses for students of computing
science.  Guile, a scheme implementation is being promoted by the Free Software
Foundation (FSF) as the extension language of choice for all future GNU
projects.

<P>
Emacs Lisp is a version of Lisp that has a large number of primitives geared
towards text editing needs.  A number of other crucial incompatibilities exist
between Elisp and Common Lisp, such as the scoping rules for variables.  These
differences are significant enough to make Elisp a very different and distinct
dialect of Lisp, rather than a mere sloppy implementation of the Common Lisp
standard (or the precursors to the standard - the two versions of Guy L. Steele
Jr.'s publication ``Common Lisp: The Language'')

<P>
This article only touches on the basics of Elisp programming.  So much so that
most of the material here applies to Common Lisp just as much as Elisp.  So,
from here on, I use the terms ``Lisp'' and ``Elisp'' interchangeably, except
where such use will lead to confusion, or there is difference in the behaviour
of the two that should be noted.
