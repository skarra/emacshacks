Lists and The ``Cons Cell'' Type</A>
</H2>

<P>
Of all the types mentioned above, the one type we have not spent much time on
already, yet demands attention is the ``cons cell''.

<P>
Lisp stands for <I>List Processing</I>, yet we have remained strangely silent
on the topic of Lists.  I am sure this is some kind of a record for
introductory texts on Lisp - to talk about lists so late. 

<P>
But before we look at lists, we need to look at <I>Cons cells</I> first.  A
cons cell is a data object that represents an ordered pair.  That is, it has
two slots, and each slot ``holds'' some lisp object.  The first slot is called
the <I>CAR</I> of the cons cell, while the other is called the <I>CDR</I>
(pronounced 'could-er') slot.  The car and cdr slots can hold objects of
different types.  A cons cell can be constructed using the <TT>cons</TT>
built-in function, as the following illustrates:

<P>
<PRE>
(setq a (cons 1 2))
(setq b (cons 10 "abcd"))
</PRE>
<P>
Two built-in functions <TT>car</TT> and <TT>cdr</TT> are available to access
the car and cdr cells respectively.

<P>
A ``list'' represents a sequence of zero or more elements.  Lists, however, are
not a primitive data type; they are built up from <I>cons cells</I>.  It does
not matter how exactly it is implemented internally; but it helps to visualise
a list as a cons cell whose cdr is either nil or another list.  So, the
following is a legit. way of creating a list:

<P>
<PRE>
(setq lis (cons 1 (cons 2 nil)))
</PRE>
<P>
This can get cumbersome when building large lists so there are short cuts,
ofcourse, like:

<P>
<PRE>
(setq lis (list 1 2))
</PRE>
<P>
The two methods yield the same results, but the first one illustrates exactly
how the list is built up, while the second one hides that detail in favour of
brevity.

<P>
You must note that the written representation of a list in a Lisp program is as
a sequence of symbols enclosed in brackets.  You must also note that this is
the precise syntax of a Lisp expression itself!! In otherwords, your Lisp
program is itself written as a series of Lists.  This is a really interesting
property, and you should spend some time reflecting on this.  Internalising
this concept would help you a little in understanding the realy profundity
behing the cliche <I>``In Lisp code is data''</I>.

<P>
