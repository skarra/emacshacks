;;; ChangeLog

;; Oct 29 2001 : * New variable ran-man--debug
;;	         * Correctly parse page names containing `.' like
;;	           adduser.conf.5.gz
;;		 
;; Mar 20 2001 : New variable ran-man--section-flag
;; Mar 20 2001 : New variable ran-man--max-tries
;; Mar 21 2001 : Fixed a bug in the usage of file-name-sans-extension, when
;;		 what was needed was something like sans-all-extensions.
;;		 The function ran-man--file-name-sans-all-extensions was
;;		 written.

;;; Installation:

;; Put this file in a directory accesible via your `load-path', and include
;; (require 'random-man) in your ~/.emacs file

;;; Commentary:

;; Then when you want to look at a random Unix man page, use the command
;; `random-man' - If all goes well, after a short while, a man page should
;; pop up in a new window.
;;
;; We attempt to look at all sections of the manual.  The biggest problem
;; is the non-standard layout of the files and differences in syntax of the
;; `man' command that is eventually called to display the stuff.  However,
;; we try to be a little smart about it and grok the man syntax of some
;; popular Unix variants like GNU/Linux, BSD, SunOS and IRIX.  If you are
;; using some other OS, then you might want to manually set the variable
;; `ran-man--section-flag'.
;;
;; Quite frequently, there are problems with your $MANPATH, or the
;; random-man package just does not grok the way man pages are laid out in
;; your file system.  This would, naturally, result in errors, but you can
;; instruct random-man to try again.  the variable `ran-man--max-tries'
;; does just that.

;;; TODO:

;; * Allow user to specify Manual Section number to get a random page
;;   from.
;; 
;; * Atleast in systems that I have access to, there seem to be a ton of
;;   Tcl/Perl kind of man pages - essentially stuff that I do not feel very
;;   interested in.  Should figure out a way to weed out these garbage
;;   pages.

;;; Code:

;; woman.el, which is a part of GNU Emacs 21 and above., is used to
;; display the man pages.  It includes a lot of other cool functionality
;; like caching all man page topics and stuff, that it is a good idea to
;; use it instead of man.el.

;; the work horse.  Look at the manual page for man to find out more about
;; how the unix command "man" works.  our function works like this:
;; 1. make a list of all components of your MANPATH var.
;; 2. generate a random number, and use this to index into the list created
;;    above to get the name of one directory containing man pages.
;; 3. check to see if this is a directory, and then make a list of all
;;    files in this directory with names man*.  these should be directories
;;    themselves.  make a note of the part of the filename that appears
;;    after "man".  this is the section number that "man" takes as argument
;; 4. look inside this directory, and create a list of all files.  strip
;;    off extension and leading path name from their filenames before
;;    creating the list.
;; 5. generate another random number and index into this list to get a
;;    random page.
;; 6. call man (from man.el) with the word just created, and the section
;;    number remembered earlier.
;;
;; We are generating random numbers three times.  and the three "levels" in
;; the function below correspond to those three steps.
